<p>How to learn <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html53/" target="_blank" title="html5 specification">Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</a> <strong>Korean is <u>not easy.</u></strong>
Particles: Korean is called an “agglutinative” language. This means you stick things onto words (at the end, for Korean) to modify the way the word is used. You use a different particle to determine whether it’s a subject or object noun. You use a different particle to make a verb future, present or past tense, or to modify formality. Korean is a very simple agglutinative language.<img src="coding.jpg" width="100%"></p>
<p style="margin-top:40px;">Not backwards in the ‘primitive’ sense of the word – I mean literally backwards. English is a S-V-O language whereas Korean is S-O-V (e.g. I went to the shop in Korean is I to the shop went). Now, this is very easy for short sentences and there’s nothing challenging about a simple sentence like I went to the shop. The problem is when you have relative clauses or longer sentences with extra information embedded in it.</P>
